## The Classic Era of Art Puzzles
Jigsaw puzzles featuring famous paintings first became popular in the early 20th century.  
Collectors and art lovers could finally “own” a masterpiece by rebuilding it piece by piece.  

Some of the most beloved classics include:  
- *Starry Night* by Vincent van Gogh  
- *Water Lilies* by Claude Monet  
- *The Kiss* by Gustav Klimt  
- *Girl with a Pearl Earring* by Johannes Vermeer  

Each piece brings not only visual pleasure but also a connection to art history.

## Modern Digital Art and Abstract Styles
In recent years, digital art and photography have expanded puzzle design beyond traditional paintings.  
Bright colors, geometric patterns, and surreal compositions give solvers fresh, modern experiences.  

These puzzles focus on color balance, symmetry, and abstract thinking — ideal for players who enjoy visual problem-solving and design aesthetics.

## The Rise of AI-Generated Puzzles
With the growth of artificial intelligence, puzzle creators can now produce entirely new artworks.  
AI-generated puzzles often mix styles: a touch of impressionism, a dash of surrealism, and unique details never seen before.  

This technology allows anyone to generate custom art puzzles in seconds — each one original and unpredictable.
