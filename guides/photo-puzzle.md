# How to Create Your Own Puzzle from a Photo

Making a puzzle from a personal photo is a fun and creative way to add meaning to your puzzling experience. Whether it’s a family portrait, a travel snapshot, or a favorite pet, turning it into a jigsaw puzzle transforms a simple image into a new challenge.

## 1. Choose the Right Photo
Select a picture that works well for puzzles:  
- High resolution so the image stays sharp  
- Clear contrasts between objects and colors  
- A theme you enjoy, such as landscapes, people, or animals  

Avoid photos that are too dark or too flat in color, as they can make solving unnecessarily difficult.

1. Upload your photo.  
2. Select the puzzle size and number of pieces.  
3. Generate the puzzle and start playing.

## 3. Adjust the Difficulty
You can decide how complex your puzzle will be by choosing the number of pieces:  
- 50–100 pieces → easy, suitable for kids or beginners  
- 200–500 pieces → medium challenge for casual puzzlers  
- 1000+ pieces → advanced level, takes longer to complete

## 4. Play and Share
Once the puzzle is ready, you can:  
- Solve it yourself for fun and relaxation  
- Share with friends or family for group play  
- Keep it as a digital memory or even print a physical copy

## 5. Save Your Work
