# Tips to Complete a 500-Piece Puzzle Faster

A 500-piece puzzle is a sweet spot for many puzzle lovers ‚Äî challenging enough to be fun, but not so large that it feels endless. If you want to finish your puzzle faster, these proven strategies will help you improve your speed without losing the joy of solving.  

---

## 1. Start with the Edges
Building the border first gives you a clear framework to work within. It also reduces the chaos of looking at 500 loose pieces with no order.  

---

## 2. Sort by Color and Pattern
Take time to group pieces before solving. Create piles for sky, grass, buildings, or other strong colors and textures. This makes it easier to focus later.  

---

## 3. Use the Picture as a Guide
Keep the puzzle box or image reference close. Constantly checking details saves time and keeps you on track.  

---

## 4. Work in Small Sections
Instead of jumping randomly across the board, complete small sections (like a corner or one object). Then connect them to the main frame.  

---

## 5. Stay Focused
Distraction breaks momentum. Set aside 30‚Äì60 minutes, play music or a podcast, and get into the ‚Äúflow‚Äù zone.  

---

## 6. Practice Online
Digital puzzles are a great way to sharpen your skills. They let you try different images and piece counts without needing space or storage.
